Before proceeding to final deployment of the model, it is important to more thoroughly evaluate the model and review the steps executed to construct the model to be certain it properly achieves the business objectives. A key objective is to determine if there is some important business issue that has not been sufficiently considered. At the end of this phase, a decision on the use of the data mining results should be reached."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SAEHAkLIsImG"},"source":["## evaluate result\n","----------\n","\n","### task\n","\n","Previous evaluation steps dealt with factors such as the accuracy and generality of the model. This step assesses the degree to which the model meets the business objectives and seeks to determine if there is some business reason why this model is deficient. Another option of evaluation is to test the model(s) on test applications in the real application if time and budget constraints permit.\n","\n","Moreover, evaluation also assesses other data mining results generated.

This review also covers quality assurance issues, e.g., did we correctly build the model?
