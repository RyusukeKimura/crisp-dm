Even if the purpose of the model is to increase knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained will need to be organized and presented in a way that the customer can use it. It often involves applying \"live\" models within an organization's decision making processes, for example in real-time personalization of Web pages or repeated scoring of marketing databases. However, depending on the requirements, the deployment phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data mining process across the enterprise. In many cases it is the customer, not the data analyst, who carries out the deployment steps. However, even if the analyst will not carry out the deployment effort it is important for the customer to understand up front what actions need to be carried out in order to actually make use of the created models.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SAEHAkLIsImG"},"source":["## plan deployment\n","----------\n","\n","### task\n","\n","In order to deploy the data mining result(s) into the business, this task takes the evaluation results and concludes a strategy for deployment.
